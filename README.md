# Introduction ✨

The static site generator I use is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
The theme I use is [hugo-profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile).  

More details below.  

## What is a static site generator? 🛠️

A static site generator (SSG) is a tool that creates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from templates and content (like Markdown). Unlike traditional CMS platforms that generate pages dynamically at runtime, SSGs build the entire site at compile time, resulting in fast, secure, and scalable websites. Examples include Hugo, Jekyll, and Gatsby.  

## Why do I use it instead of building a classic SPA? 🤔

This website is not intended to be the greatest or the best-designed portfolio ever made. I could build one in React with Tailwind or Material-UI to achieve a mid-level result that wouldn't satisfy me or would take me time I would prefer to spend on more interesting projects.  

So, using a static site generator here allows me to showcase what I want to showcase with a minimal amount of effort.  

Plus, the one I chose is written in Go, and is reputed to be the fastest ever made. So I wanted to try it to see for myself.  

## How did I achieve this result? 🚀

I won't take credit for work that is not mine; my website derives from an open-source Hugo theme named [hugo-profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile).  

The GitHub Pages setup is the one from the official documentation of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  

## What did I really achieve here? 🎯

Nothing much. The whole theme was already done. I compared the few I enjoyed the most visually and, given the example site in the theme folder, I populated my `/hugo.yaml`, which is responsible for the instantiation of the layout created by the theme.  

I customized it to edit what I wanted to keep and delete what I wanted to remove.  

Finally, I just created my content, and that will mainly be the next contribution I make to this repository, such as:  
- ✍️ Creating new posts  
- 📂 Adding new projects  
- 📝 Fixing typos  
- 📄 Updating my resume section  

And maybe adding new types of content if I want to do so!  
Or perhaps changing the theme if I grow tired of this one.
